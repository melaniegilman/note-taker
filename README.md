## Description
This application is very simple and easy to use.  The user simply needs to click the "Get Started" button on the home page, and then fill in a note by clicking in the input areas for "Note Title" and "Note Text".  If the user would like to delete a note, this is possible by clicking on the red trashcan icon. Notes persist when the page is refreshed.
